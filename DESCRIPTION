Description: The pomdp package enables the user to simply define all components
    of a POMDP model such as states, transitions, and rewards in various ways
    and then transforms all the inputs into a suitable and POMDP-friendly 
    structure. The package then utilizes the 'pomdp-solver' to solve the user-defined
    problem using finite grid method and provides outputs such as optimal policy
    and solution. The package also visualizes the solutions.
