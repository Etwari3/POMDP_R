Description: Provides an interface to pomdp-solve, a solver for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP). The package enables the user to simply define all components of a POMDP model and solve the problem using several methods. The package also contains functions to analyze and visualize the POMDP solutions (e.g., the optimal policy).
